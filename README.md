   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = Your Supabase project URL (found in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API)

### Setting up locally

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory

   VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```
3. Restart your development server

**Note:** Never commit `.env.local` to git. It should be in your `.gitignore` file.
